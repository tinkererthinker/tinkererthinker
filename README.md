## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What I'm doing now

Currently, I'm studying mechanistic interpretability from the perspective of a math student. MI is the field of reverse engineering neural networks.

I'm also attempting to understand the chord protocol which answers the question "How to efficiently locate the node that stores a specific piece of data in a network of nodes?". I got interested in internet protocols after reading "where wizards stay up late - the origins of the internet" which made me wonder why computer networks have been invented in the first place.
- Diffusion of Innovations, diffusion of the internet
- My main background is in memetics or cultural science. Generally speaking, I'm doing research on how ideas are being replicated and how they spread in social systems.
